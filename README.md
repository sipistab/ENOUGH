# Preface

I have only shared this project directly with the ones I most respect. I hold your presence in high esteem. My hope is that this work proves valuable to you, aiding your personal journey. Please use it as you see fit, for your benefit and growth.

I was inspired by the concepts presented in "The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem" book. While I highly recommend reading it, it is not essential for the exercises to be effective.

Please note that this is only a passion project of mine as I learn how to develop applications, I did not request the author's premission to use his work and neither is this a commercial application. Please do not distribute this application without my premission. Nathanial dedicated a lifetime to creating this masterpiece. His family receives royalties from the sold copies, so if you enjoy his work, please consider purchasing the book.
