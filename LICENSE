Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, "rightsholder(s)") of an original
work of authorship and/or a database (each and all, "work").

CC0 enables that work to be placed as completely as possible in the public
domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the work
for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.

CC0 is a universal instrument that is not adapted to the laws of any
particular legal jurisdiction. If a jurisdiction needs some additional
terms or different terms, you may add them to the CC0 terms or create a
separate instrument for that jurisdiction.

CC0 is not an instrument for software licensing. CC0 is intended for
other types of works, such as content, data, or documentation. For
software, we recommend the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
License.

CC0 is not a license to use the work. CC0 is a method for, in effect,
waiving copyright and database rights in the work to the extent
permitted by law.
