name: "Starting Strength Linear Progression"
description: |
  A systematic strength training program based on Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength methodology.
  
  Program Structure:
  - Alternating Week A/B workouts
  - 3 workouts per week (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday)
  - Progressive overload with consistent weight increases
  - Emphasis on compound barbell movements
  
  Progression System:
  - Weight increases after successful completion of all sets
  - Squat/Deadlift: 5kg/session
  - Bench/Press/Power Clean: 2.5kg/session
  - Assistance exercises: Progress when able
  
  Warmup Protocol:
  1. Empty bar: 2x5 for form practice
  2. 50% of work weight: 5 reps
  3. 70% of work weight: 3 reps
  4. 90% of work weight: 2 reps
  
  Deload Protocol:
  - Triggered after 3 consecutive failed sessions
  - Reduce weight by 10% (round to nearest 2.5kg)
  - Reset progression from deloaded weight
  - If stalled 3 times, consider program advancement
