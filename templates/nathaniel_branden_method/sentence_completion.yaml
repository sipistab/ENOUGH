name: "Nathaniel Branden's Sentence Completion Method"
description: |
  The Sentence Completion Method is a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth developed by Dr. Nathaniel Branden.
  
  How it works:
  1. Each week focuses on a specific theme through sentence stems
  2. Monday through Friday: Complete 6-10 different endings for the same stem
  3. Weekend: Reflect on all completions from the week
  4. Process repeats with new stems each week
  
  Program Structure:
  - Weekday sessions (Mon-Fri): Same stem used for 5 consecutive days
  - Weekend reflection (Sat/Sun): Review the week's responses
  - Each completion should be thoughtful and honest
  - Minimum 6 completions required, up to 10 allowed
  - 5-minute time limit per session to encourage spontaneity
  
  Deloading:
  - If unable to complete minimum responses for 3 consecutive days
  - If responses become repetitive or shallow
  - System will suggest taking a break and resuming with simpler stems
