# ENOUGH - The Growth Journal

A command-line tool for personal development through structured journaling and reflection exercises, with a particular focus on the **Nathaniel Branden sentence completion method**.

## What This Is

ENOUGH is a minimal journaling application that guides you through a 30-week program of sentence completion exercises designed to build self-esteem and personal awareness. Based on the work of Nathaniel Branden, each exercise presents an incomplete sentence that you complete with your own thoughts and feelings.

## The Method

**Nathaniel Branden Sentence Completion Method:**
- **Every morning (Monday-Friday)**: Complete ALL stems for that week
- **Each stem**: 6-10 rapid completions (work quickly, don't pause to think)
- **Weekend**: Reflect and compile your responses
- **Duration**: 30 weeks of progressive exercises

**Example Week 1:**
- Monday: Complete all 4 stems (6-10 completions each)
- Tuesday: Complete all 4 stems again (6-10 completions each)
- Wednesday: Complete all 4 stems again (6-10 completions each)
- Thursday: Complete all 4 stems again (6-10 completions each)
- Friday: Complete all 4 stems again (6-10 completions each)
- Weekend: Reflect and compile

## Program Structure

- **30 weeks** of progressive exercises
- **142+ sentence stems** organized by theme
- **Daily practice** (Monday-Friday)
- **Weekly assessment** (Weekend reflection)
- **Progress tracking** with automatic week/day calculation

## Usage

```bash
# Install
pip install enough-journal

# Run
