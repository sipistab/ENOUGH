  reflection: |
    Today started with good energy after a full night's sleep. Morning routine is becoming more consistent, though I still need to work on not checking my phone first thing.
    
    Yesterday's challenges with the project timeline helped me realize I need to be more proactive in communicating potential delays. Will implement this learning today.
